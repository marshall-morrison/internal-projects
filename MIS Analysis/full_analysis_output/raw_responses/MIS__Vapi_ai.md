}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document chunk is somewhat fragmented with incomplete sentences and URL references
- Clear information about billing model, payment processor, and pricing structure is present
- Some ambiguity exists around specific threshold values and whether they're fixed or variable
- The context suggests this is internal documentation with abbreviations (AE, DRI, PLG) that are interpretable but not explicitly defined
- Missing some details about exact pricing rates and complete implementation procedures

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.72):**
- The document chunk is brief and lacks detailed context, which limits certainty about specific implementation requirements
- Terminology like PLG and SLG is clear, but their exact operational definitions may vary by organization
- No explicit exceptions or conditional logic is provided, making it difficult to assess edge cases
- The chunk appears to be part of a larger document, so full context is missing
- Core themes are identifiable, but specific business rules would benefit from additional documentation
