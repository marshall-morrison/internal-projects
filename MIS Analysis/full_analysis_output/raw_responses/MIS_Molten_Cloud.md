**Confidence Reasoning**: The document appears to be internal operational instructions with some formatting issues and incomplete sentences. While the core rules and themes are identifiable, there are ambiguities (e.g., "How do we handle taxes as a line item" appears to be an unanswered question), and some instructions lack complete context. The confidence score reflects clear extraction of operational rules but uncertainty about complete context and some unresolved questions within the document itself.
