**Reasoning for low confidence score**: The document chunk appears to be incomplete or corrupted data (truncated URLs, repetitive structure, missing context). It looks like metadata or logging information rather than formal instruction documentation. The analysis is based on pattern recognition of what appears to be call tracking data, but without complete URLs, full context, or accompanying instructions, the extracted rules are largely inferred rather than explicitly stated.

**Reasoning for confidence score**: The document provides clear structural elements about the implementation process and handoff procedures, but the content is somewhat fragmented and appears to be extracted from a larger document. The billing information is incomplete ("Info on how merchant bills Annual contracts..."), and the context around some procedures could be clearer. The core workflow stages are evident, but detailed requirements for each stage are not fully specified.
