**Confidence Rationale**: The document appears to be a template or form with both filled and unfilled sections. While the structure and default rules are clear, some sections contain fragmented information (particularly the Rewatch Calls section) and the context suggests this is merchant-specific documentation for "Messari" based on the internal channel reference. The confidence is moderate (0.75) because the operational defaults are explicit, but some merchant-specific details are incomplete or require additional context to fully interpret.
