```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.72):**
- The document appears to be fragmented notes or meeting summaries with incomplete sentences and formatting issues
- Some context is missing (e.g., what the experimental pricing entails, specific product line details)
- Clear stakeholder information and billing model structures are present
- The rules around handoff processes and billing requirements are identifiable but could benefit from more detail
- Merchant-specific elements are clearly identifiable but lack complete context
