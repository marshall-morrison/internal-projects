**Reasoning for confidence score**: The document chunk appears to be fragmented or mid-sentence, making complete context difficult to establish. The structure suggests internal process documentation, but some sentences are incomplete (e.g., "Notes Sections [Ops International Team to Ignore] (AE to fill if they have, Implementation to be completion DRI on handoff)"). The numbered list is also incomplete (jumps from 1 to 3, missing item 2). Despite these limitations, the core themes around duplicate handling, team responsibilities, and merchant information capture are reasonably clear.
