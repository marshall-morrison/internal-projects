**Confidence Reasoning**: The document is somewhat fragmented and contains incomplete sentences, making some sections difficult to interpret with full certainty. However, the core operational rules around Usage AI configuration, defaults, and workflow responsibilities are clearly stated. The confidence is reduced due to formatting issues, incomplete sections (marked for post-go-live completion), and some ambiguous phrasing. The merchant-specific examples (Statsig, Pinata, Messari) provide good context but suggest this is a template with variable content.

```

**Note:** The confidence score is relatively low (0.45) because the document chunk appears to be fragmented or improperly formatted data, possibly from a call log or CRM export. The content lacks clear instructional language, complete sentences, or explicit rules. The analysis is based on pattern recognition from what appears to be metadata or system-generated tracking information rather than formal merchant instructions.
