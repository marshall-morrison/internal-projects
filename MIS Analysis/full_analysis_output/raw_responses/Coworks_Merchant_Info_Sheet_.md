    "The term 'Tabs features' refers to specific product capabilities that would vary by implementation",
    "Key POC identification process may differ based on merchant's organizational structure",
    "Decision maker hierarchy may be merchant-specific",
    "Feature priorities will vary significantly by merchant based on their business needs and use cases"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document chunk is brief and appears to be part of a larger questionnaire or checklist
- The context is clear regarding stakeholder identification and feature assessment
- However, limited context about the broader process, what "Tabs" specifically refers to, and how this fits into the overall workflow
- The fragment nature (starting with "2)") indicates missing preceding content that could provide additional context
