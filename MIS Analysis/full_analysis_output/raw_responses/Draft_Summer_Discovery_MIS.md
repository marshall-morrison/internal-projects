**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.65):**
- The document chunk is quite brief and uses minimal formatting, making interpretation somewhat ambiguous
- The structure suggests a comparison or mapping between fee types and their accounting treatment
- The relationship between "fee" and "deposit" categories is clear, but context about the business model is limited
- Some implicit rules can be inferred, but the terse format leaves room for multiple interpretations
- No examples or edge cases are provided to validate the interpretation
