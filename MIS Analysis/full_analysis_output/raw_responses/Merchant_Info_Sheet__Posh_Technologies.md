```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.72):**
- The document appears to be a template or form with many incomplete fields (indicated by blank spaces and "N A" entries)
- Some sections are clearly fragmented or missing text (e.g., "Usage billing for ___ of API calls")
- The structure is clear, but specific details are often missing or redacted
- Core operational defaults and processes are identifiable despite incomplete information
- The merchant-specific section at the beginning provides concrete details, but many template fields remain unfilled

```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is somewhat fragmented and appears to be a template or form with incomplete sections
- Some fields (like "FR 1 What is it Why it's important Urgency") appear to be headers without filled content
- The context is clear enough to extract meaningful patterns, but the incomplete nature reduces certainty
- The notification rules and documentation requirements are explicit and clear
- The merchant-specific elements are identifiable but would benefit from more complete examples
