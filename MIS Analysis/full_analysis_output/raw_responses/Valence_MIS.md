  "confidence_score": 0.75

```

**Confidence Score Rationale:** The score of 0.75 reflects moderate-to-high confidence. The document chunk is clearly instructional with specific rules, but it appears incomplete (text cuts off mid-sentence, references external mapping tables not included, and contains formatting issues). Some context about the broader system and complete revenue category mappings would increase confidence to 0.9+.

```

**Confidence Rationale**: The document structure is clear with explicit defaults and phase-based responsibilities. However, some sections are incomplete (marked as "to fill"), and certain abbreviations (like "BT") are not fully defined. The merchant-specific example (Messari/Azmat Aziz) provides concrete context, but the fragmented nature of the text (especially URLs and some incomplete sentences) reduces certainty about edge cases and complete operational procedures.
