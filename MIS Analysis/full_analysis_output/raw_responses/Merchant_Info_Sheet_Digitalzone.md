**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is clear with identifiable sections and defaults
- Some sections are marked as "(Implementation Success to fill)" indicating incomplete information
- The example provided (Messari/Azmat Aziz) helps clarify the notification protocol
- Certain abbreviations (BT, FR, AE) are used without full definitions, though context makes them interpretable
- The document appears to be a template with placeholders, so some merchant-specific details are not yet populated
- The formatting and structure suggest this is an operational guideline document, but some sections lack detailed content
