    "Billing model follows recurring straight-line methodology"
  ],

    "Contract is written poorly - requires assumption about Net 30 terms being pre-calculated in due date",
    "Merchant (Laurel) has complicated ERP transition creating tracking issues",
    "Head of Finance may be using personal spreadsheet instead of official systems for invoice tracking",
    "Mark as paid functionality is compromised due to dual-system update requirements",

```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document contains clear operational rules and merchant details
- Some ambiguity exists due to informal note-taking style ("its a mess", "unclear the latest here")
- Several items marked as "n/a" limit complete understanding
- The "poorly written contract" note suggests interpretation may be required
- Strong confidence in explicit rules like "Integration item should always be Sales"
- Lower confidence in exception handling due to ongoing unresolved issues
