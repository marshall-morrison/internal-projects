```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is clear and follows a template format, making themes identifiable
- Several explicit default rules are stated clearly (service term, payment terms, billing frequency)
- Some sections are incomplete with "(Implementation Success to fill)" placeholders, reducing certainty about complete rule set
- Examples provided (Statsig, Pinata, Messari) help clarify application but may not represent all cases
- The document appears to be partially filled out, with some sections containing actual merchant data while others remain as templates
- Text formatting issues and incomplete sentences (document cuts off mid-sentence) suggest this may be a partial or corrupted document

  "merchant_specific": [

    "Product name: 'Tabs' - appears to be the merchant's product or platform name",
    "Feature categories: 'Invoicing' and 'Usage' - these specific features may be customizable or configurable per merchant implementation",
    "The term 'key POC' suggests there may be multiple points of contact with varying levels of importance"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document chunk is brief and appears to be notes or answers to specific questions
- Context is somewhat limited, making it harder to extract comprehensive rules
- The structure suggests this is part of a larger discovery or requirements gathering process
- Clear identification of stakeholder and features, but lacking detail on processes or workflows
- Some ambiguity about whether this is prescriptive guidance or descriptive documentation
