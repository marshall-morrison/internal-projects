**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is clear with defined sections and responsibilities
- Phase-based handoff procedures are explicitly stated
- Some ambiguity exists due to incomplete sentences and formatting issues (appears to be a template or partially filled form)
- The Gong.io URLs are truncated, suggesting this is an excerpt
- Some context may be missing about what triggers certain actions or the complete workflow
