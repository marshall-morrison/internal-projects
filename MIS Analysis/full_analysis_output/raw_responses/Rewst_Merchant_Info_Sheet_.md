    "Key POC (Point of Contact): Jason Lopez, Controller - indicates specific stakeholder relationship",
    "NMI gateway requirement - suggests merchant has existing relationship or preference for this specific payment processor",
    "QuickBooks integration - indicates merchant uses QuickBooks as their accounting system",
    "Slack-based collaboration - indicates merchant's internal communication platform preference",
    "Usage-based billing and tiering - suggests merchant's specific business model requires consumption-based pricing"

  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document clearly lists specific features and requirements
- Context suggests these are requirements for a billing/finance automation system (likely Tabs platform)
- Some ambiguity exists as this appears to be a fragment of a larger document (starts with ")")
- The relationship between the POC and requirements is clear but implementation details are not provided
- Missing information about priority levels, implementation timelines, or success criteria
