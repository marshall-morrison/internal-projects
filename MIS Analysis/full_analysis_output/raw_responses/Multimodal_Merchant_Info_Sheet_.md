    "Product feature prioritization and requirements",
    "Customer point of contact (POC) management",

    "Feature priorities (Invoicing and usage) - may vary by merchant based on their business needs",

    "The term 'Tabs features' suggests a specific product or platform that may have merchant-specific configurations"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The content is brief and appears to be notes or responses to specific questions
- Context is somewhat limited (appears to be part of a larger questionnaire or form)
- Clear identification of stakeholder and features, but lacks detail on implementation or broader policies
- Some ambiguity about whether these are general requirements or specific to one customer case
