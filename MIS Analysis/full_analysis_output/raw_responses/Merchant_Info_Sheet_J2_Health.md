```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.72):**
- The document appears to be fragmented or incomplete, with several placeholders like "[Check with Azmat]" and "[Attach the list here]"
- Some sections are clearly defined (invoice requirements, J2 integration, default terms)
- Other sections are vague or truncated (Events Processing, Feature Requests, Rewatch Calls)
- The structure suggests this is part of a larger documentation system, so context may be missing
- Core rules are extractable, but some details require clarification from named individuals
