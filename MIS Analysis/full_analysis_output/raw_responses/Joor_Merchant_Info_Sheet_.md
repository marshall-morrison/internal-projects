**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence with "2) Is there a key POC: (i e")
- Some context is missing (references to "Ops International Team to Ignore" and "AE Implementation to fill" suggest template sections)
- Core information about billing, contracts, and merchant preferences is clear and extractable
- The fragmented nature and apparent template structure reduces confidence that all rules and requirements have been captured
