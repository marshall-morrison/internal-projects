**Reasoning for Confidence Score:**
The document chunk appears fragmented and lacks complete sentence structure, making interpretation challenging. While key themes and rules are identifiable, the incomplete nature of the text (missing context, truncated phrases) reduces certainty about the precise meaning and completeness of the extracted information. The score of 0.65 reflects moderate confidence - the main ideas are discernible but details may be incomplete or require additional context.
