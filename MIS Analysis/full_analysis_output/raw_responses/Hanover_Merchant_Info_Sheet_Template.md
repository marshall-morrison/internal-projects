**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is somewhat fragmented and contains incomplete sentences
- Some sections are clearly labeled (e.g., examples, notification protocols) providing high confidence
- Other sections are truncated or unclear (e.g., "POC: (i" cuts off)
- The "Ops International Team to Ignore" section suggests some content may not be universally applicable
- Clear patterns emerge despite formatting issues, but missing context reduces certainty about implicit rules
