```

**Rationale for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The instructions are relatively clear but brief, leaving some ambiguity
- "Initial term" could be interpreted in multiple ways without additional context
- The relationship between "contract processing" and "first invoice" notification timing is not fully explicit
- No information about error handling, retry logic, or notification failure scenarios
- Missing details about what happens after the initial term or with subsequent contracts
