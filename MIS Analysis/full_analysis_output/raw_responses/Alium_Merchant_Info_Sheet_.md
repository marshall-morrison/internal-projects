    "Field usage preferences (e.g., leaving certain fields blank like 'Item Description' and 'Integration Item')"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document chunk appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence with "e g")
- Some instructions reference elements not fully explained ("Anything to ignore in contracts" section is incomplete)
- The context is clear enough to extract main themes and most rules
- Some ambiguity exists around merchant-specific variations due to incomplete information
- The structure suggests this is part of a larger instruction set
