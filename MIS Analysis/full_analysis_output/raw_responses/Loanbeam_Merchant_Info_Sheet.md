**Confidence Reasoning**: The score of 0.75 reflects high confidence in the themes and rules extracted, but reduced confidence due to: (1) the document appears to be truncated (ends mid-sentence with "VOE vs"), (2) some context may be missing about the broader implementation, and (3) certain recommendations lack specific details about execution. The stakeholder information and key implementation recommendations are clear and well-defined, supporting the relatively high confidence score.
