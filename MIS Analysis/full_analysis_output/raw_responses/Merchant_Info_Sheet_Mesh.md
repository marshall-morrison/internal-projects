}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document is very brief and appears to be a questionnaire or checklist rather than detailed instructions
- The intent is clear (gather merchant intelligence), but implementation details are minimal
- "Tabs features" suggests a specific product, but without more context about what Tabs is, some interpretation is required
- The three questions are straightforward but lack guidance on how to assess or document the answers
