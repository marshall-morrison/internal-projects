  "rules": [
    "Augusto is designated as the implementation lead",
    "Invoice generation capability must be included",
    "Dunning functionality is required",
    "Stripe payment integration must be implemented",
    "QuickBooks (QB) integration is mandatory",
    "CashApp payment option must be supported",
    "Hubspot CRM integration is required"
  ],
  "exceptions": [
    "The merchant is characterized as 'fairly easy to work with', suggesting potential for smoother implementation compared to standard difficulty levels"
  ],
  "merchant_specific": [
    "Point of contact: Augusto (implementation lead)",
    "Specific integration stack: Stripe, QuickBooks, CashApp, Hubspot - this combination may be unique to this merchant",
    "The term 'Tabs features' suggests merchant may be using or referring to a specific product/platform called 'Tabs'",
    "Priority features list appears customized to this merchant's operational needs"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score:**
The confidence is moderate (0.75) because while the document clearly lists required features and identifies a key stakeholder, it lacks context about:
- Whether these are all required features or just areas of interest
- Implementation timeline or phases
- Priority ordering of integrations
- Specific configuration requirements for each integration
- The full scope of "Tabs features" being referenced
