}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document chunk appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence about Fixed Fee Contracts)
- Some context is clear (multi-brand operations, billing processes, contract vs. pricing distinction)
- However, missing information about the second customer type and incomplete sentences reduce certainty
- The fragmented nature suggests this is an excerpt from a larger document, potentially missing critical details
- Terminology and specific requirements are clear enough to extract meaningful patterns, but completeness cannot be verified

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document appears to be a template or form with partially filled information
- Some sections are incomplete (e.g., "FR 1" details, "Is there a key POC" cuts off)
- Clear structure and explicit role assignments increase confidence
- Specific merchant details (NetSuite, usage-based billing) are present but context is limited
- The incomplete nature of some sections reduces certainty about full requirements
