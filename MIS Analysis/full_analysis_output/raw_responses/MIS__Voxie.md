  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document appears to be a template with clear structural rules, which increases confidence
- Some sections are marked as incomplete ("IM to fill", "IMP to Add", "Implementation to fill")
- The content cuts off mid-sentence at the end ("For usage-based rates (e g"), indicating incomplete information
- The rules extracted are explicit and well-structured, but context about edge cases may be missing
- The distinction between general rules and merchant-specific elements is reasonably clear

**Confidence Rationale**: The document chunk appears to be a fragment from a larger instruction manual with some formatting issues and incomplete sentences. While the core rules and themes are identifiable, the fragmented nature and missing context (especially around "Implementation Success to fill Post-Go Live" sections) reduce confidence. The merchant-specific examples (Statsig, Pinata, Messari) are clear, but the overall document structure suggests this is part of a larger workflow that isn't fully visible.

}
```

**Note:** The confidence score is relatively low (0.45) because this document chunk appears to be a fragmented log or list of call records rather than a structured instruction document. The content lacks clear instructional language, complete sentences, and explicit rules or policies. The analysis is based on inferring patterns from what appears to be metadata or system-generated records, which limits the ability to extract definitive merchant instructions.

}
```

**Reasoning for low confidence score**: The document chunk appears to be fragmented or poorly formatted data, possibly extracted from a table or log file. The content lacks complete sentences, clear context, and detailed instructions. This makes it difficult to extract definitive rules or understand the full scope of requirements. The analysis is based on pattern recognition rather than explicit instructions.
