    "Step-up pricing and quantity changes over contract lifecycle",
    "Quarterly invoicing cadence with monthly period tracking",
    "Product sequencing across multiple contract periods",

    "Multi-product bundling with different pricing structures"
  ],
  "rules": [
    "Products with two lengths must be sequenced across the life of the contract",
    "Step-up pricing changes are incorporated into quarterly invoicing cadence",
    "Implementation fees are charged in Month 1 as a one-time charge",
    "AI Voice product has $0.00 charge for Month 1-2 period",
    "Field product pricing: $59 per unit for months 1-2 (25 units = $2,950)",
    "Field product pricing: $59 per unit for months 3-10 (45 units per month)",
    "First invoice includes: Implementation (Month 1), AI Voice (Month 1-2), Field (Month 1-2), and Field (Month 3)",
    "Subsequent invoices follow quarterly periods: Invoice 2 covers months 4-6, Invoice 3 covers months 7-9, Invoice 4 covers months 10-12",
    "All amounts shown are inclusive of discounts",
    "Quantity changes mid-contract require separate line items on the first invoice"
  ],
  "exceptions": [
    "First invoice (Invoice 1) contains multiple period ranges and products, breaking from the quarterly pattern",
    "Month 3 Field product is billed separately on Invoice 1 despite being part of the step-up period",
    "AI Voice product appears to be included but has zero charge during initial period",
    "Implementation is a one-time charge only appearing on first invoice",
    "The transition from 25 to 45 units creates a split billing scenario in the first invoice"
  ],
  "merchant_specific": [
    "Product names: 'Implementation', 'AI Voice', 'Field' - likely specific to this merchant's service offerings",
    "Pricing structure: $199 implementation fee, $59 per Field unit - merchant-specific pricing",
    "Contract length: 12-month contract period may vary by merchant",
    "Step-up quantities: 25 units to 45 units transition - specific to this contract",
    "Quarterly invoicing cadence - may differ for other merchants (monthly, annual, etc.)",
    "Two-month initial period before step-up - timing may be merchant or contract specific"
