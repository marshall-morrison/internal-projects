  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document appears to be incomplete with several sections marked "to fill" by implementation teams
- Some information is clear and explicit (autocharge, no opt-out, west coast location)
- Other areas lack detail (specific contract processing steps, billing model details)
- The fragmented nature and note-taking style suggest this is a work-in-progress document
- Core themes and merchant-specific details are identifiable, but operational rules may be incomplete

**Confidence Reasoning:**
- **High confidence (0.82)** due to clear articulation of business goals, pain points, and requirements
- **Confidence reduced by:** Date inconsistencies (Go Live before Demo/MSA dates), missing information (Scoping start date "n a", no ERP/Tax Integration details, missing GTM/Implementation POC names)
- **Strong clarity on:** Business objectives, stakeholder roles, specific feature requirements (bundles, SSP, collections, autopay)
- **Ambiguity exists around:** Technical implementation details, exact bundle pricing rules, and timeline accuracy
