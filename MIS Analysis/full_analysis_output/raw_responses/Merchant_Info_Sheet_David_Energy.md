**Confidence Reasoning**: The document provides clear operational defaults and specific calculation examples, but the formatting is somewhat fragmented with incomplete sentences and unclear punctuation. Some sections reference processes "if necessary" without full details (events billing, integration items), and the "(Tabs)" designation context is unclear. The core billing rules and defaults are explicit and well-defined, but some merchant-specific implementation details would benefit from clarification.
