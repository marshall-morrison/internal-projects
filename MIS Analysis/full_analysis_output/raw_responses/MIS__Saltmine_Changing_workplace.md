**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document provides clear operational instructions and merchant details, but lacks complete context
- Some abbreviations (GBR, INR, DRI) are interpretable but not explicitly defined
- The document appears to be a fragment with references to external Loom videos that contain additional information not available in this chunk
- The structure and key rules are clear, but the full scope of implementation requirements would require reviewing the referenced video content
- Merchant-specific elements are identifiable, but their complete implications may require additional documentation
