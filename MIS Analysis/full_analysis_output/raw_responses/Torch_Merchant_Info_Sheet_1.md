```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.65):**
- The document appears to be fragmented notes or a partially complete implementation guide
- Some sections are incomplete (e.g., "Customer Information Katie and Anthony both comes from audit background and they said that they can" - sentence cuts off)
- Abbreviations and shorthand make some meanings ambiguous (N A, DRI, AE)
- Clear structure exists for feature requests and some processes
- Lack of complete context reduces certainty about implicit rules and relationships between sections
