**Reasoning for confidence score**: The document appears to be fragmented notes or bullet points, making some context unclear. The core information about contract rules, feature priorities, and stakeholder preferences is relatively clear, but the incomplete sentences and abbreviated format (e.g., "Rev Rec" for Revenue Recognition) suggest this may be partial documentation. The confidence is moderate because while key facts are identifiable, the full context and complete requirements may not be captured in this chunk.
