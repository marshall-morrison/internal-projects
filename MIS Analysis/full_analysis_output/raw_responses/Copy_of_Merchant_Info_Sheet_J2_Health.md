**Confidence Rationale**: The document appears to be fragmented or poorly formatted, making some sections difficult to interpret with full certainty. The core rules and themes are identifiable, but some sections (like "Feature Requests FR 1 What is it Why it's important Urgency Rewatch Calls Rewatch by dates") appear incomplete or improperly formatted, reducing confidence in capturing all intended information. The score of 0.75 reflects reasonable confidence in the main themes and rules while acknowledging potential gaps due to document formatting issues.
