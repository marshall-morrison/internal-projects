```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The content is clear and explicit about feature requirements
- Context suggests this is from a sales/requirements discovery document
- Some ambiguity exists around whether these are mandatory requirements or desired features
- Limited context about the broader document structure and whether this represents complete requirements
- "Tabs" appears to be a specific product name, but relationship to merchant operations could be clearer
