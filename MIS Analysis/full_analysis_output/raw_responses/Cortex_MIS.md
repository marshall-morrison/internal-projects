**Confidence Reasoning**: The document structure is clear and contains explicit default values and rules. However, the confidence score is reduced to 0.82 due to:
- Some formatting irregularities and incomplete sentences (e.g., "N A" for Events Processing)
- Ambiguous abbreviations (BT Events, IDP) without full definitions
- The "Rewatch Calls" section appears truncated
- Some sections marked as "(if necessary)" suggest conditional application but lack complete criteria
