**Analysis Notes:**
- The document appears to be internal processing instructions with some incomplete sections (placeholders like "Check with Azmat" and "Attach the list here")
- The confidence score is moderate (0.72) due to fragmented formatting and missing information that would need clarification
- Several elements require external verification or merchant-specific input before full implementation
- The document mixes general rules with specific merchant customizations
