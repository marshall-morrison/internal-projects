    "Product-led growth (PLG) strategy",
    "Customer segmentation (self-serve vs. enterprise)",
    "Implementation and handoff processes"
  ],
  "rules": [
    "QuotaPath uses two primary billing models for different customer segments",
    "PLG billing is powered by Stripe Subscriptions",
    "Self-serve customers use an embedded self-checkout flow within QuotaPath's UI",
    "PLG billing model is designated for smaller customers",
    "Account Executives (AE) are responsible for filling notes sections if available",
    "Implementation team serves as the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for completion on handoff"
  ],
  "exceptions": [
    "Billing model selection depends on customer size and type (smaller self-serve customers use PLG/Stripe)",
    "The document implies a second billing model exists but details are not provided in this chunk",
    "Notes sections are conditionally filled only if AE has information available"
  ],
  "merchant_specific": [
    "QuotaPath-specific terminology: 'PLG billing', 'self-checkout flow'",
    "QuotaPath's UI contains embedded checkout functionality",

  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.72
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score**: The document chunk appears to be incomplete or fragmented (references to call IDs, incomplete sentences about billing models). While clear themes and some rules are extractable, the context suggests this is part of a larger document, and key information (such as the second billing model) is missing. The confidence is moderate because the extracted information is accurate for what's present, but completeness cannot be assured.
