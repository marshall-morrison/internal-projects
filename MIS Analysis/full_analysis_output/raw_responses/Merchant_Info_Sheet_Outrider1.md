**Confidence Reasoning**: The document is relatively well-structured with clear sections and explicit rules. However, some areas lack detail (e.g., GTM POC and Implementation POC are blank, some sections marked as "if necessary" have no content), and there are formatting inconsistencies that suggest this may be a template partially filled out. The confidence is reduced slightly due to these gaps and the informal nature of some entries (e.g., "No" as complete answers).
