**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document appears to be partially complete (cuts off mid-sentence: "2) Is there a key POC: (i e")
- Some context is clear (notification protocols, billing model, feature requests)
- However, certain sections lack detail or appear truncated
- The Gong URL and encoded parameters suggest external references that cannot be verified
- The structure indicates this is part of a larger merchant onboarding or operations document
- Core operational rules are clearly stated, but some nuances may be missing due to incomplete content

```

**Confidence Reasoning**: The document is well-structured with clear sections and explicit default rules. However, several sections are incomplete or contain placeholder text (e.g., "Anything to ignore in contracts", empty fields for GTM POC, Implementation POC, Tax Integration). The confidence score of 0.85 reflects high certainty about the extracted themes and explicit rules, but acknowledges that some merchant-specific details are missing or templated, suggesting this may be a partially completed onboarding document.
