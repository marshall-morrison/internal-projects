**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- Document is clearly structured but contains multiple "N/A" fields indicating incomplete information
- Several sections marked for "Implementation Success to fill" are empty (Customer Information, Feature Requests details)
- Core rules and workflow are clearly stated with good specificity
- Some ambiguity exists around the remittance use case scope
- Missing details on tax handling, events processing, and customer-specific requirements lower confidence
- Strong clarity on QBO integration, billing frequency mapping, and communication protocols
