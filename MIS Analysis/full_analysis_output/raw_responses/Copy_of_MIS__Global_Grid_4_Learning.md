**Confidence Reasoning**: The document is somewhat fragmented and contains incomplete sentences, making some sections difficult to interpret with full certainty. However, the core billing rules, contract types, and processing steps are relatively clear. The confidence score reflects uncertainty around some incomplete sections (like "BPOS TO IGNORE THIS PART" mid-sentence) and ambiguous references, but high confidence in the main operational rules extracted.
