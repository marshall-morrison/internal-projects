**Reasoning for confidence score**: The document appears to be a structured reference sheet with video links and categorical placeholders. While the structure is clear, the content is minimal with several "None" values, making it difficult to extract comprehensive rules. The format suggests this is part of a larger system, but context about the broader merchant instruction framework is limited. The confidence is moderate because the themes and structure are identifiable, but the sparse content limits deeper rule extraction.
