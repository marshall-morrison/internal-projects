```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document chunk appears incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence on "How do we handle taxes as a line item")
- Clear rules and defaults are well-defined for most operational parameters
- Some ambiguity around "Anything to ignore in contracts" section
- Merchant-specific customization areas are mentioned but not fully detailed
- Core operational defaults and processing rules are explicit and actionable

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.65):**
- The document chunk is very brief and appears to be a summary or note rather than detailed instructions
- Core intent is clear (automation with oversight + support access), but specific implementation details are missing
- Lack of context about what is being automated, audit criteria, or support protocols
- The phrase "They cared a lot" suggests this is a retrospective note about merchant preferences rather than formal instructions
- More detailed documentation would be needed for higher confidence in extracting comprehensive rules
