    "Security and legal requirements likely customized based on merchant's industry and compliance needs"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.45
}
```

**Reasoning for Low Confidence Score:**
- The document chunk appears to be a fragment of meeting titles/links rather than complete instruction content
- Limited context about actual rules, requirements, or detailed procedures
- Cannot determine specific requirements, thresholds, or detailed policies from titles alone
- Missing substantive instruction content that would normally contain explicit rules and guidelines
- The analysis is based primarily on inferring process flow from meeting titles and dates
