  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.65
}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score:**
The document appears to be fragmented or incomplete, with inconsistent formatting and some unclear sentence structures (e.g., "Special memo s certain invoices require"). The content seems to be notes or an outline rather than a fully formatted instruction document, which makes it challenging to extract precise rules. However, the main themes and general requirements are identifiable, hence a moderate confidence score of 0.65.
