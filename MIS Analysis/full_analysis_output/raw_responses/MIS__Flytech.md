**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document chunk is brief and appears to be extracted from a larger context (possibly a requirements or discovery document)
- Clear pain points are identified, but specific business rules or requirements are not explicitly detailed
- The "Why it matters" framing suggests this is explanatory/justification content rather than formal policy documentation
- Merchant-specific elements are clearly identifiable, but the full scope of requirements is likely contained in other document sections
- Some ambiguity exists around whether the two spreadsheets serve different purposes or represent redundant tracking
