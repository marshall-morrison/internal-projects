  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.65
}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score:**
The confidence score is moderate (0.65) because:
- The document chunk appears to be fragmentary or part of a larger context
- The numbering suggests this is an excerpt (item 3 following item 2 about Jerry and Ashish)
- The connection between the POCs and the features is implied but not explicitly stated
- Limited context makes it difficult to determine if these are requirements, preferences, or observations
- The format suggests note-taking or bullet points rather than formal documentation
