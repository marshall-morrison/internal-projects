}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document structure is clear with numbered questions
- Some ambiguity exists around whether "Anthony" is the merchant name or contact name
- "SDFC" likely means Salesforce but uses non-standard abbreviation
- The informal tone and fragmented writing style suggests this may be internal notes rather than formal documentation
- The pattern is generalizable but limited sample size from single merchant example
