  "confidence_score": 0.75
}
```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document appears to be a template or form with some fields completed and others marked as "to fill"
- Clear information about goals, pain points, and termination clauses
- Some ambiguity due to incomplete sections and fragmented formatting
- The connection between "speed up bidding process" at the beginning and the rest of the content is unclear
- Missing details on the unique customer creation process and billing model reduce certainty

```

**Confidence Reasoning:**
- **Reduced to 0.75** due to:
  - Date inconsistency (Go Live Date before Demo date suggests possible error or missing context)
  - Multiple empty fields (Scoping start date, GTM POC, Implementation POC, ERP, Tax Integration) make it difficult to extract complete rules
  - Unclear whether this is a template or actual merchant data
  - The "90 days after start date (July 1)" calculation doesn't align clearly with any provided start date in the document
- **Strengths**: Clear company description, explicit role assignment (AE responsibility), identifiable stakeholder information

```

**Reasoning for confidence score (0.75):**
- The document provides clear information about payment rules, stakeholder identification, and integration requirements
- Some context is missing (e.g., what specific Tabs features the POC cares about - question #3 appears cut off)
- The relationship between quota exhaustion and the "4th installment" suggests a specific payment structure, but full details aren't provided
- Merchant temperament and relationship details are subjective assessments rather than objective rules
- The distinction between different customer types (PLG vs. standard) is mentioned but not fully elaborated
