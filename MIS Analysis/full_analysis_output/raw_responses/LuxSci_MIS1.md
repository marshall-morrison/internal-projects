**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is clear with labeled sections and examples
- Explicit rules for categorization and notifications are well-defined
- Some ambiguity exists around incomplete sections (marked with "to fill")
- Context about the broader workflow and system is limited
- The document appears to be a template with placeholder information, making some interpretations uncertain
