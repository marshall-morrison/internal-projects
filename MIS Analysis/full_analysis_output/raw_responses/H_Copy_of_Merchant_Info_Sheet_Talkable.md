```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.72):**
- The document appears to be fragmented notes or a summary rather than complete formal instructions
- Some context is missing (e.g., what "peach row" specifically refers to, full details on feature implementations)
- The structure suggests internal notes with abbreviated terminology
- Clear actionable items are present but lack comprehensive detail
- Referenced video links provide supporting material but content is not visible in this chunk
