**Reasoning for confidence score**: The document appears to be a partial template or meeting notes with incomplete sentences and fragmented structure. While the core intent around merchant onboarding handoff procedures is clear, the incomplete nature of the content (numbered list starting at 1 then jumping to 3, incomplete sentences, URL fragments) limits certainty about the complete set of rules and requirements. The score reflects moderate confidence in the extracted themes and rules based on context clues, but acknowledges potential missing information.
