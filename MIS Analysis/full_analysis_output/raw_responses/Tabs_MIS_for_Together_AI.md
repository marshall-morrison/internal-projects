  "confidence_score": 0.3
}
```

**Reasoning for Low Confidence Score:**

This document chunk appears to be a reference list or index of call recordings rather than a traditional instruction document. It contains:
- Call IDs and URLs without context
- Minimal descriptive information
- No explicit instructions, rules, or procedural guidance
- Fragmented text that suggests it may be extracted from a larger document or system

The content is primarily metadata for tracking purposes rather than actionable merchant instructions. A more complete document context would be needed to extract meaningful rules and patterns for merchant operations.

}
```

**Reasoning for Low Confidence Score:**
The document chunk appears to be a simple list of Gong.io call reference links without substantial contextual information, instructions, or explanatory text. This makes it difficult to extract comprehensive rules or understand the full purpose and requirements. The content seems to be reference material rather than instructional documentation, limiting the ability to identify clear operational rules or patterns beyond basic call tracking practices.

**Reasoning for Low Confidence Score:**
The provided content appears to be incomplete URL fragments and call references rather than full instruction documentation. The text is fragmented, lacks complete sentences, and doesn't contain explicit instructional language or detailed rules. The analysis is based on inferring patterns from call titles and URL structures, which limits confidence in extracting comprehensive and accurate rules. A complete document would likely provide much clearer instructions and requirements.
