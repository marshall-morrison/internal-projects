**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document chunk is brief and appears to be a list of requirements or features rather than detailed instructions
- Context is limited - unclear if these are requirements for a system being implemented, features being offered, or capabilities being evaluated
- No explicit conditional logic, thresholds, or detailed procedures provided
- The items listed are clear but lack specificity about implementation details
- Moderate confidence that the themes and rules are accurately captured, but lower confidence about implicit exceptions and full merchant-specific customization needs without additional context
