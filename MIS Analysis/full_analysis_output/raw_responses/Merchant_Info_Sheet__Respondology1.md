}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document structure is clear with labeled sections
- Several fields contain "none" which provides definitive information about what is NOT required
- The subscription model rule is explicitly stated as "standard - default"
- However, context is limited - unclear if "none" means "not applicable" or "not yet configured"
- The feature request section appears truncated and lacks detail about actual requests
- Some ambiguity about whether this is a complete document or an excerpt
