**Confidence Reasoning**: The document appears to be a template or instruction guide with some sections incomplete (marked as "to fill"). The structure is clear but some content is fragmented or contains placeholder text. The rules extracted are explicit and clear, but context about the overall system and some abbreviations (BT, SOW, AE) requires domain knowledge. The confidence is moderate due to incomplete sections and some ambiguous references.

  "confidence_score": 0.65
}
```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score:**
The confidence score of 0.65 reflects moderate uncertainty due to:
- The document chunk appears incomplete (starts mid-sentence with ")")
- Context is limited, making it difficult to understand the full scope of requirements
- Some terminology like "trust concerns" is vague without additional context
- The relationship between different systems and workflows is not fully clear
- However, the core themes around automation, integration, and approval workflows are reasonably clear
