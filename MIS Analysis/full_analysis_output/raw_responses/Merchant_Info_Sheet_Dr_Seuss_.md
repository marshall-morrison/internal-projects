**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document chunk is fragmented with incomplete sentences and unclear acronyms, reducing certainty
- Timestamps suggest this is extracted from conversation logs or meeting notes rather than formal documentation
- Some context is missing (e.g., what MMB and CMF fully stand for)
- However, the core processes and numerical values are specific and consistent enough to extract meaningful patterns
- The business logic around MG tracking, invoicing, and commission handling is clear despite formatting issues
