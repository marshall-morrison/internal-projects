```

**Reasoning for Confidence Score (0.75):**
- The document is clearly instructional but appears incomplete or truncated in several places
- Multiple references to "screenshots" and "examples" that are not visible in the text, limiting full context
- Some sentences are incomplete (e.g., "Specifics processing things the merchant has requested that may differ by contract (e g")
- The structure is clear enough to extract meaningful rules and patterns
- Some ambiguity exists around which elements are universal vs. merchant-specific
- The document mixes general challenges/context with specific processing instructions
